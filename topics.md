# Topic Ideas

## Software Engineering

- Error Handling / Top Mistakes (e.g., ignore the nested cause; split logs up; just trust your framework)
- Git rebase
- Git reference branch workflow (w/ directory diff)
- Fierce Ownership
- Fierce Shared Ownership
- Patterns (GoF considered slightly harmful)
- Management by exception (leadership antipattern)
- "Nobody gets fired for buying IBM" (leadership antipattern)
- Platform equivocation (architecture antipattern)
- Alphabet soup recruiting (antipattern)
- The C Minus Engineer (career antipattern)
- Platform Stockholm Syndrome (architecture antipattern)
- "You Can Do That Just as Well With..." (or, different languages, same code - architecture antipattern)
- Popular things I'm skeptical of (dynamic typing; convention/configuration instead of code; autowired DI; ORMs; schemaless DBs; undeclared nulls)
- Bifurcations (void vs returning; object vs primitive/struct; standard function vs continuation; C# delegate vs interface; array vs collection vs...)
